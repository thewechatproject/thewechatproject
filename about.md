        <p>We’re The WeChat Project, a group of progressive, second-generation Chinese Americans adding our voices to existing conversations on WeChat. Over the past few years, WeChat has slowly garnered a reputation for circulating increasingly right-wing, often misinformed content to nearly one billion users. This can be particularly harmful to Chinese American communities, whose political views are influenced by the influx of right-wing content on social media that rarely goes challenged.</p>
				<p>
				We’re here to provide alternative, progressive perspectives to some of the most hotly debated issues in WeChat: affirmative action, police brutality, protest, systemic racism, LGBTQ+ issues, and more. You can find our articles on progressive WeChat microblogs, such as ChineseAmerican.org. We are doing this not out of a place of pure resistance and criticism, but out of care and compassion for our community. We want to advocate for Asian American racial equity and justice in ways that don’t scapegoat other marginalized communities; we believe our community can do better, and deserves better.
